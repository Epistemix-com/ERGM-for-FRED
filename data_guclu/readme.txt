Supplementary network files for SMART Project paper

Each school’s contact network is given in four different network formats including Pajek (extension “net”), edge list (extension “edgelist”), GML (extension gml), GraphML (extension “graphml”), and NCOL (extension: “ncol”). 

In the network files the vertex shape denotes the grade of the student as follows:

"ellipse": Kindergarten
"box": 1st grade
"diamond": 2nd grade
"triangle": 3rd grade
"ellipse x_fact 1 y_fact 3": 4th grade
"box x_fact 1 y_fact 3": 5th grade
"diamond x_fact 1 y_fact 3": 6th grade
"triangle x_fact 1 y_fact 3":7th grade
"ellipse x_fact 3 y_fact 1": 8th grade
"box x_fact 3 y_fact 1": 9th grade
"diamond x_fact 3 y_fact 1": 10th grade
"triangle x_fact 3 y_fact 1": 11th grade
"ellipse x_fact 5 y_fact 1": 12th grade
