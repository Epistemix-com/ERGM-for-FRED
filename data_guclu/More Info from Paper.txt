Over multiple deployments, in total, 1,828 students and 116 teachers and staff wore motes, and 232 motes were deployed at fixed locations within the schools (stationary motes). We labeled each school depending on the school district type and level, i.e., a label X-Y in which X denotes the school district (P for public and C for charter) and Y denotes the school level (ES for elementary school, EM for elementary-middle school, MS for middle school, and HS for high school). In each deployment, we covered the entire student population, except in one of the middle schools (P-MS2) and one of the high schools (P-HS) due to large student populations. To remedy this, for P-MS2 and P-HS, we randomly selected classrooms from different grades.
